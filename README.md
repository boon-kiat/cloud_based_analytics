### Problem Statement:
Propose a cloud-based data analytics framework for global econonomy dataset. The framework should cover various layers of the data lifecycle process, including data ingestion, storage, processing, analytics, visualization, and other layers based on your project's requirements.

### Objective:
- To perform data lifecycle processes using different cloud-based tools throughout the data lifecycle framework.
- To perform trade volume, tariff line and rate analysis. 
- To compare the query performance among the analysis performed in BigQuery in terms of latency, memory and number of records for read and written.

### Dataset:
- “World Export & Import Dataset (1989-2023)” dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadtalhaawan/world-export-and-import-dataset/data)
- Contain information on international trade and trade policies with 33 features and 8096 rows.

### Methodology:
- Data ingestion using Google Cloud Storage
- Data storage using BigQuery
- Data processing using Vertex AI Colab Enterprise
- Data analytics using BigQuery
- Data visualization using Looker Studio
